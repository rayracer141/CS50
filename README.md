Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is focused on my baking hobby and allows me to share it with my friends. Although the site itself is still in the infancy I was able to complete the requirements. 

Most of the requirements can be viewed on /countryBread.html 
 - You can see an un-ordered list above the recipe, and on step 6 is where you can see an ordered list.
 - Bootstrap components included the alerts I use as suggestions, and the nav bar itself.
 - The recipes are using a two column Bootstrap layout "<div class="col-12 col-md-6">"


The /styles.scss has comments where the CSS requirement examples can be found.
